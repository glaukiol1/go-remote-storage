# üìÅ go-remote-storage
Remote File Storage written in Go (server) & Python (client).


  
## ‚ÑπÔ∏è General Info

This is a project which demonstrates a secure and easy way to program a remote file storage application. It has user accounts, which are stored in a MongoDB database. Users can login using the _gostore-client_ python program. Each user has their own folder, and they can perform actions, or run commands. All these commands or actions are being proccessed by the Server. To make this interaction user-friendly, I have created a VSH (virtual shell) in which users can run simple commands and get prompts instead of having to manually send packets to the server. The _vsh_ is also a part of _gostore-client_.
